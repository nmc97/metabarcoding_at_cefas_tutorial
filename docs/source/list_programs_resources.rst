Tutorial: `Metabarcoding 16s tutorial <https://www.microbiomeanalyst.ca/MicrobiomeAnalyst/resources/tutorials/MDP.pdf>`_

Uses: `Metacoder: An R package for visualization and manipulation of community taxonomic diversity data <https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005404>`_ . Vizualising abundance comparisons in unique heatmap tree format. This is a good alternative to the stacked bar charts normally used to vizualise species abundance and compare conditions.

.. topic :: pros and cons

  Con : cannot automate - but you can download the R scripts to endure you can trace back what you have done
  Pros: Excellent when you don't use R and do not need to automate the output. Can be used directly after using Dadaist2 - outputs are supplied.

Statistical anaylsis

Installation :  Download a an extract folder into project directory - do this individually for each project. Use the installation script "install_packages.R" to install packages required.
