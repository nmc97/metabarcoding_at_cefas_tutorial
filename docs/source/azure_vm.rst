=======================================
Azure Virtual Machine for Metabarcoding
=======================================

To assist Cefas staff in conducting metabarcoding studies we have developed a :term:`Virtual Machine` hosted on Azure.
This is equipped with all the software we think you will need to run your analyses without you needing to download software yourself.
It includes an installation of :term:`Galaxy` which hosts many useful programs and allows you to use a graphical interface rather than the command line.

GUI - graphical user interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are planning to use the Graphical user interface then we recommend the use of :ref:`frogs`. This is hosted within Galaxy.
Frogs combines multiple metabarcoding tools into one, and is designed to be user friendly.

Command-line
^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you would like to stick to the command line, we would recommend using either :ref:`Dada2` or :ref:`Dadaist2`, depending on how comfortable you are with each program.
