```

## Microbiom R package plotting

You may need to modify to apply to your data

Prerequisites : 

- microbiome R package 

- dplyr


```{r}

# load libraries
library(microbiome) 
library(microbiomeutilities) 
library(dplyr)




```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
